# Solving popcount problem on Quantum Computer

This repository contains the report created for the exam in the course ACIT4321 - Quantum Information Technology (OsloMet). 
In the report we write about our work on Quantum algorithms for solving spesific popcount problems. We explore different methods for creating the algorithms for different input sizes.
